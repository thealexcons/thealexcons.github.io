                <p>
                    A classic C/C++ problem every developer has come across at some point is the deserialisation of raw byte buffers, such as network packets or binary files, into Plain Old Data (POD) structures.
                    The most obvious (and conventional) solution to this problem is to simply interpret the bytes as the type of the object you are parsing. Consider the following code: 
                </p>

                <pre><code class="language-cpp">struct __attribute__((packed)) MessageHeader {
    uint32_t seq_no;
    uint16_t msg_type;
    uint16_t msg_len;
};

void onPacket(uint8_t *buffer, size_t size) {
    if (size < sizeof(MessageHeader)) return;

    const auto *hdr = reinterpret_cast&lt;const MessageHeader *&gt;(buffer);
    if (hdr->msg_type == 0)
         foo();
    else
         bar();
}</code></pre>

                <p>
                    Assuming correct alignment and field offsets, the code above looks correct. In fact, this code will work (or at least on most modern compilers). However, this 
                    code snippet has undefined behaviour. When reading the <tt>hdr->msg_type</tt> field, we are violating the strict aliasing rules defined by the language standard.
                    The strict aliasing rules dictate that an object can only be accessed through pointers of its own type (or a compatible type like char). However, we are
                    instructing the compiler to treat the sequence of bytes as a <tt>MessageHeader</tt> object. 
                </p>

                <h2>UB-free solutions</h2>
                <h3>Using <tt>memcpy</tt></h3>
                <p>The safe way to solve the problem without violating strict aliasing is to use <tt>memcpy</tt>:</p>

                <pre><code class="language-cpp">MessageHeader hdr;
                    std::memcpy(&hdr, buffer, sizeof(MessageHeader));</code></pre>

                <p>Modern compilers often optimise memcpy to generate efficient code, especially for small structs (however, there is no guarantee of this).</p>
                
                <h3>Placement new</h3>
                <p>Another alternative is to use placement new:</p>
                
                <pre><code class="language-cpp">MessageHeader *hdr = new (buffer) MessageHeader;</code></pre>

                <p>While this method avoids aliasing issues, it unnecessarily calls the constructor of MessageHeader, even when the buffer already contains a valid object representation.</p>

                <p>None of the two solutions above are ideal: we simply want to move pointers around and treat the memory as if it already was an object of type T. To understand how to solve this
                    problem without invoking undefined behaviour, we need to first understand object lifetimes in C++. 
                </p>

                <h2>Back to basics: object creation</h2>
                <p>
                    When we learn C++, we are taught that there are two steps involved when creating an object:
                    <ol>
                        <li><<b>Memory allocation</b>, to reserve storage for the object</li>
                        <li><<b>Object construction</b>, to initialise a valid representation of the object</li>
                    </ol>
                    Whether you are allocating on the stack or on the heap, both are true (though stack allocation is "automatic" and handled by the compiler). An exception is the placement new operator,
                where only the second step takes place (i.e.: we assume the memory has already been allocated).
                </p>
                <p>In reality, there is a third step which is often overlooked (and understandably so because it is transparent to us): <b>lifetime initialisation</b>. Whenever we call the constructor,
                the compiler will also associate the object type with the underlying allocated memory, so that it can keep track of aliasing information. The following table summarises the three steps:</p>

                    </tbody>

                <h2>Object lifetimes</h2>
                
                <p>Now you might be asking yourself: <i>is there any way to only perform the third step, i.e.: initialise a lifetime for an object without calling the constructor?</i> If there was, then
                it would solve the strict aliasing violation in the deserialisation program presented at the start of this article.</p>

                <p>This is exactly what <tt>std::start_lifetime_as</tt> (introduced in C++23) aims to solve: it explicitly starts the lifetime of an object at a given memory location without invoking the constructor.
                We can update our original program:</p>

                <pre><code class="language-cpp">void onPacket(uint8_t *buffer, size_t size) {
    if (size < sizeof(MessageHeader)) return;

    const auto *hdr = std::start_lifetime_as&lt;const MessageHeader *&gt;(buffer);
    if (hdr->msg_type == 0)
         foo();
    else
         bar();
}</code></pre>

                <p>The function above does not break strict aliasing rules (as it ensures the object has a valid lifetime before use) and does not perform any copies. In fact,
                the compiler should produce the exact same code as the original program, except that now the compiler is happy! üòÑ</p>

                <h3>Compiler support</h3>
                <p>
                As of the time of writing (March 2025), no major compiler has implemented <tt>std::start_lifetime_as</tt>. An approximate implementation using C++20's <tt>std::memmove</tt>
                    (which implicitly starts a lifetime at the destination buffer) is a workaround (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76445860/implementation-of-stdstart-lifetime-as" target="_blank">source</a>):
                </p>

                <pre><code class="language-cpp">template&lt;class T&gt;
requires (std::is_trivially_copyable_v&lt;T&gt; && std::is_implicit_lifetime_v&lt;T&gt;)
T* start_lifetime_as(void* p) noexcept {
    return std::launder(static_cast&lt;T*&gt;(std::memmove(p, p, sizeof(T))));
}</code></pre>
                
                <p>However, the <tt>std::start_lifetime_as</tt> construct is guaranteed to not access the memory, whereas the code above does not provide the same guarantees.</p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    C++23‚Äôs <tt>std::start_lifetime_as</tt> provides a robust solution for safely treating raw byte buffers as structured objects while avoiding undefined behavior. 
                    Although it is not yet widely implemented, its introduction marks a significant advancement in memory management and type safety in modern C++ development.
